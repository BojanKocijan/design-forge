# Design Forge

**A Claude Code plugin that makes Claude work like a disciplined senior product engineer — for UX and frontend work.**

Design Forge is a set of binding *laws*, reusable *skills*, and shared *knowledge files* that govern every Claude Code session: how it scaffolds a React app, how it names branches and opens PRs, how it writes components, how it runs UX research, and how it hands work off to developers. Library-agnostic. No corporate toolchain required.

> Think of it as a constitution for your AI pair-programmer: announce before acting, branch + issue before code, never push to `main`, never merge for you, no inline styles, WCAG 2.2 AA, no bloated code, no hallucination.

## Why

Out of the box, an AI assistant will happily push to `main`, invent APIs, over-engineer, and forget your conventions between sessions. Design Forge fixes that with **26 binding laws** Claude must follow, plus knowledge files that travel with you to every project:

- **Disciplined git** — pull `main`, branch + issue before code, PRs only, Claude never merges, proactive branch cleanup.
- **Pre-execution announcements** — Claude tells you what it's about to change (and its severity) before touching anything.
- **Senior-engineer thinking** — YAGNI, edge-case analysis upfront, "verify before claiming" (no hallucination), reason out loud before executing.
- **Consistent frontend** — 4-file component folders, no inline styles, TypeScript, React Router architecture, accessibility baked in.
- **Whole workflows** — new-project scaffolding, UX research → deck, feature lifecycle, and a two-surface developer handoff.

## Install

Design Forge works **today** with Claude Code and the Claude CLI. A one-click install from the Claude/Cowork marketplace is **coming soon** (see [below](#coming-soon-marketplace)).

### Path A — Claude Code / Claude CLI (recommended, works today)

Installs the rules into Claude's **global memory** so every session on your machine inherits them automatically.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BojanKocijan/design-forge/main/install.sh | bash
```

What it does:

1. Clones the repo to `~/.design-forge`
2. Injects `@~/.design-forge/CLAUDE.md` into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Claude's global memory)
3. Installs the `dforge-update` shell function for pulling the latest rules

Verify by opening any session — you should see a `Rules loaded: DESIGN_FORGE v2.0.0` confirmation line. Keep rules fresh anytime with `dforge-update`.

### Path B — Clone and use it yourself

Prefer to read, fork, or adapt the rules? Just clone the repo and point Claude's global memory at it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BojanKocijan/design-forge.git ~/.design-forge
# then add this line to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md:
#   @~/.design-forge/CLAUDE.md
```

From here you own it — edit the laws, knowledge, and skills to fit your workflow.

### Path C — GitHub Copilot

Paste the contents of [`CLAUDE_LAWS.md`](./CLAUDE_LAWS.md) into your Copilot custom instructions (VS Code settings, JetBrains, or github.com → Copilot → custom instructions).

### Coming soon: marketplace

The repo already ships a valid plugin manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`) and marketplace descriptor (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`), so a one-click install from the **Claude / Cowork marketplace** will be available once Design Forge is submitted to and listed by Anthropic. Until then, use Path A or B above.

## Commands

Type these in any Claude Code session:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `new project` | Scaffold Vite + React + TypeScript. Asks platform, UI library, **app architecture** (routing / shell / data flow / auth), deployment, then builds it with CI + tests. |
| `update rules` | Pull the latest rules and reload them in this session |
| `check rules` | Print the loaded version + git status of the rules clone |
| `load rules` | Re-import the rules without pulling |
| `start feature` | 3-question triage → tracks an active feature in `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` |
| `pause feature` / `resume feature` / `finish feature` | Feature lifecycle management |
| `handoff <id>` | Generate a 13-section developer handoff doc + a tracking issue |
| `fullstack mode` | Activate the Fullstack persona (backend, APIs, auth, CI/CD) |
| `frontend mode` | Return to the default Frontend persona |
| `research mode` / `research mode full` | UX research → 6-slide outcome deck (or 12–18 slide full deck) |
| `pendo mode` | Pendo product-analytics persona |
| `dry run` / `auto git` | Toggle "print the git/gh commands for me to run" vs "Claude runs them" |
| `stop preview` / `start preview` | Control the background `npm run dev` |

## How it works

Design Forge has three layers:

### 1. Laws — [`CLAUDE_LAWS.md`](./CLAUDE_LAWS.md)

26 binding rules Claude must follow. Highlights:

- English-only · pre-execution announcement before any change
- Pull `main` → branch + issue → code → PR · **never push to `main`, never merge for you**
- Check for existing PRs before starting (no duplicate work)
- Proactive branch cleanup after merge
- No inline styles (4-file component folders) · Conventional Commits · secret scanning · PII-free mock data · WCAG 2.2 AA
- YAGNI · edge-case thinking · verify-before-claiming · reason-before-executing
- `dry run` mode — print git/gh commands for you to run instead of spending tokens

### 2. Personas

| Persona | Scope | Activated by |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** *(default)* | Mockups, prototypes, React, a11y, localStorage, mocked data | default |
| **Fullstack** | + backend, APIs, auth, any DB, CI/CD, deployment | `fullstack mode` |
| **Design** | Figma, critique, UX writing | Figma/design tasks |
| **Research** | Transcripts, JTBD, RICE + MoSCoW, decks | `research mode` |
| **Pendo Analyst** | Product analytics via Pendo MCP | `pendo mode` |

### 3. Knowledge — [`knowledge/`](./knowledge/)

Binding guides Claude reads before acting: `FRONTEND_GUIDE`, `PROJECT_SCAFFOLD`, `COMPONENT_PATTERNS`, `SKILLS`, `UX_RESEARCH_GUIDE`, `FULLSTACK_WORKFLOW`, `FEATURE_WORKFLOW`.

Full version history: [`RELEASES.md`](./RELEASES.md).

## Wiring a project

**You never wire the laws per project** — Path A and Path B load them globally for every session. A project only needs its own context in a one-line `CLAUDE.md`:

```
@./PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md
```

You don't type this by hand: `new project` writes it for you, and for an existing project Claude creates it automatically the first time you do code work.

> Don't add `@~/.design-forge/CLAUDE.md` to a project — it's redundant (laws are global) and breaks the repo on machines without Design Forge.

---

## Project registry

Design Forge can assign each of your projects a **locked localhost port** so running several `npm run dev` servers in parallel never clashes. Your personal registry lives in `projects.yaml`, which is **gitignored** — copy the template to start:

```bash
cp projects.example.yaml projects.yaml
```

Claude auto-registers new projects (issue → branch → PR) and locks the port in `vite.config.ts` with `strictPort: true`. Your project list stays private to your machine.

---

## Updating

- **Installed (Path A):** run `dforge-update`, or `git -C ~/.design-forge pull`
- **Cloned (Path B):** `git -C ~/.design-forge pull`
- In any session: type `update rules`

---

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Every change follows the project's own laws: branch + issue first, Conventional Commits, PRs only, CI (markdownlint) must be green. See [`CLAUDE_LAWS.md`](./CLAUDE_LAWS.md) for the full workflow.

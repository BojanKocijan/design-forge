# Design Forge

**A governance framework for AI-assisted software engineering — 31 binding laws that make Claude Code work like a disciplined senior product engineer.**

Design Forge is a set of binding *laws*, reusable *skills*, and shared *knowledge files* that govern every Claude Code session. It controls how Claude scaffolds projects, names branches, opens PRs, writes components, runs UX research, and hands work off to developers. Library-agnostic. Framework-agnostic. No corporate toolchain required.

> Think of it as a constitution for your AI pair-programmer: announce before acting, branch + issue before code, never push to `main`, never merge for you, small atomic PRs, no inline styles, WCAG 2.2 AA, no bloated code, no hallucination.

## Why Design Forge

Out of the box, an AI coding assistant will happily push to `main`, invent APIs, ship 1000-line PRs, over-engineer, and forget your conventions between sessions. Design Forge fixes that with **31 binding laws** and knowledge files that travel with you to every project.

| Problem | Design Forge solution |
|---|---|
| Pushes directly to `main` | Branch + issue before code; PRs only; Claude never merges |
| Giant, unreviewable PRs | **Law 31** — every PR under 400 lines, one concern per PR, stacked sequences for large features |
| Over-engineered code | YAGNI enforcement, edge-case analysis upfront, verify-before-claiming |
| Forgets your conventions | 31 laws + 9 knowledge files loaded every session |
| Inconsistent components | 4-file component folders, no inline styles, TypeScript, accessibility baked in |
| No audit trail | Pre-execution announcements, Conventional Commits, living `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` |
| Stale repos | Auto branch cleanup, orphaned issue detection, README kept current with every PR |

---

## Quick start

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BojanKocijan/design-forge/main/install.sh | bash
```

Open any Claude Code session. You should see:

```
Rules loaded: DESIGN_FORGE v2.10.0
Project: <your-repo>
Persona: Frontend
GitHub: <your-username>
Ready.
```

That's it. Every session on your machine now follows the laws.

---

## Installation

### Path A — Claude Code / CLI (recommended)

The install script clones the repo to `~/.design-forge`, injects the rules into Claude's global memory (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`), and installs the `dforge-update` shell function.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BojanKocijan/design-forge/main/install.sh | bash
```

<details>
<summary>What the script does</summary>

1. Clones this repo to `~/.design-forge`
2. Adds `@~/.design-forge/CLAUDE.md` to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (Claude's global memory)
3. Installs the `dforge-update` shell alias for one-command updates

</details>

### Path B — Manual clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BojanKocijan/design-forge.git ~/.design-forge
```

Then add this line to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`:

```
@~/.design-forge/CLAUDE.md
```

### Path C — GitHub Copilot

Paste the contents of [`CLAUDE_LAWS.md`](./CLAUDE_LAWS.md) into your Copilot custom instructions (VS Code, JetBrains, or github.com Settings > Copilot > Custom instructions).

### Marketplace (coming soon)

The repo ships a valid plugin manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), so a one-click install from the Claude / Cowork marketplace will be available once listed by Anthropic.

## Architecture

Design Forge has three layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CLAUDE_LAWS.md — 31 binding rules              │
│  (loaded every session)                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  agents/ — 8 specialized personas               │
│  Frontend · Backend · Lead · Tester             │
│  Design · Research · Analyst                    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  knowledge/ — 9 binding guides                  │
│  (loaded on demand per task scope)              │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  skills/ — 16 reusable skill definitions        │
│  (auto-discovered by Claude Code)               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Laws — [`CLAUDE_LAWS.md`](./CLAUDE_LAWS.md)

31 binding rules. Key highlights:

- **Transparency** — pre-execution announcement before any change; Claude waits for explicit approval
- **Git discipline** — pull default branch, branch + issue before code, PRs only, never push to default branch, never merge
- **Small atomic PRs** — every PR under 400 lines, one concern per PR, stacked sequences for large features, squash-merge by default
- **Code quality** — 4-file component folders, no inline styles, Conventional Commits, secret scanning, PII-free mock data, WCAG 2.2 AA
- **Engineering rigor** — YAGNI, edge-case thinking, verify-before-claiming, reason-before-executing
- **Repo hygiene** — immediate branch cleanup, stale branch sweeps, orphaned issue detection, README always current
- **Safety controls** — `arm` / `disarm` toggle; `dry run` mode; three hard-safety rails always survive (never merge, no secrets, no PII)

### Personas

Seven specialized roles compose into a single pipeline:

| Persona | Scope | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | UI, React, a11y, mocked data | *default* / `frontend mode` |
| **Backend** | APIs, auth, DB, migrations, observability | `backend mode` |
| **Lead** | Orchestrates the full team pipeline | `team` / `fullstack mode` |
| **Tester** | Tests, axe/coverage gate, can block the PR | `tester mode` |
| **Design** | Figma, design critique, UX writing | *(implied by design tasks)* |
| **Research** | Transcripts, JTBD, RICE/MoSCoW, deck generation | `research mode` |
| **Analyst** | Product analytics (Pendo, Amplitude, Mixpanel, ...) | `analyst mode` |

### Knowledge — [`knowledge/`](./knowledge/)

| File | Scope |
|---|---|
| `FRONTEND_GUIDE.md` | React, components, styling, TypeScript, a11y |
| `COMPONENT_PATTERNS.md` | Shared component patterns and refactoring |
| `PROJECT_SCAFFOLD.md` | New project scaffolding (Vite + React + TS) |
| `FULLSTACK_WORKFLOW.md` | Production PR flow (10 phases) |
| `TEAM_WORKFLOW.md` | Multi-agent team pipeline |
| `FEATURE_WORKFLOW.md` | Feature lifecycle (start/pause/resume/finish) |
| `SKILLS.md` | Layout, a11y, testing, handoff, git craft |
| `UX_RESEARCH_GUIDE.md` | Transcript analysis, research decks |
| `ANALYTICS_GUIDE.md` | Product analytics workflows |

---

## Commands

### Core workflow

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `new project` | Scaffold a new app — asks platform, UI library, architecture, deployment |
| `start feature` | 3-question triage, tracks active feature in `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md` |
| `pause feature` | Park the current feature, free the slot |
| `resume feature` | Pick up a paused feature |
| `finish feature` | Close the feature, archive it, run handoff if ready |
| `handoff <id>` | Generate 13-section developer handoff + tracking issue |

### Team and personas

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `team` / `build feature` | Start the Lead-orchestrated pipeline (plan > build > test > document > review) |
| `frontend mode` | Switch to Frontend persona (default) |
| `backend mode` | Switch to Backend persona |
| `tester mode` | Switch to Tester persona |
| `fullstack mode` | Activate the Lead (team orchestrator) |
| `research mode` | UX research — produces 6-slide outcome deck |
| `research mode full` | Full 12-18 slide research deck |
| `analyst mode` | Product analytics persona |

### Safety and governance

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `disarm` | Suspend laws for this session (hard-safety rails survive) |
| `arm` | Restore full governance |
| `dry run` | Claude prints git/gh commands instead of running them |
| `auto git` | Exit dry-run mode |
| `update rules` | Pull latest rules and reload |
| `check rules` | Print loaded version and update status |
| `stop preview` / `start preview` | Control the background dev server |

---

## Working with the team

Every session starts as **Frontend**. The team pipeline is opt-in.

**Start the full pipeline:**

```
team
# or with context:
build feature: add CSV export to the invoices page
```

The **Lead** runs it end-to-end — scope, build, test, document, review, PR — pausing for your approval on multi-file edits (Law 2) and stopping at "PR open, CI green" for you to merge (Law 7).

**Or call a single role:**

| Goal | Trigger |
|---|---|
| Build / change UI | `frontend mode` *(default)* |
| Build an API, DB, auth | `backend mode` |
| Full feature with the team | `team` / `build feature` |
| Write and run tests | `tester mode` |
| Design critique, Figma work | *(design task)* |
| Transcript analysis | `research mode` |
| Product analytics | `analyst mode` |

Every agent obeys [`CLAUDE_LAWS.md`](./CLAUDE_LAWS.md). If an agent thinks it should break a rule, it stops and asks (Law 29).

---

## Wiring a project

Laws load globally — you never wire them per project. A project only needs its own context via a one-line `CLAUDE.md` at the project root:

```
@./PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md
```

`new project` creates this automatically. For existing projects, Claude creates it the first time you do code work.

> **Note:** Never add `@~/.design-forge/CLAUDE.md` to a project-level file — it's redundant (laws are global) and breaks the repo on machines without Design Forge installed.

---

## Project registry

Design Forge assigns each project a **locked localhost port** so running multiple `npm run dev` servers never clashes. The registry lives in `projects.yaml` (gitignored, local to your machine):

```bash
cp projects.example.yaml projects.yaml
```

Claude auto-registers new projects and locks the port in `vite.config.ts` with `strictPort: true`.

---

## Updating

| Method | Command |
|---|---|
| Shell (Path A) | `dforge-update` |
| Manual (Path B) | `git -C ~/.design-forge pull` |
| In any session | `update rules` |

---

## Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. All contributions follow the project's own laws:

1. Branch + issue before code (Law 5)
2. Conventional Commits (Law 13)
3. PRs only — no direct pushes to `main` (Law 7)
4. Small, atomic PRs under 400 lines (Law 31)
5. CI (markdownlint) must pass

See [`CLAUDE_LAWS.md`](./CLAUDE_LAWS.md) for the full governance framework.

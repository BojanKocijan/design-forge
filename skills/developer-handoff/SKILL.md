description: Package a completed UX design for developer implementation — generates docs/handoffs/<id>.md (13-section template) and opens a tracking issue in the GitHub Issues repo. Invoke when the user says "hand off", "ship to dev", "create the handoff for <id>", or runs the `handoff <id>` trigger. Never reply with chat-only links — always generate the file and the issue.

# Developer Handoff

## When to invoke

The user says: "hand off", "ship to dev", "prepare handoff", "create the handoff for <id>", or uses the `handoff <id>` trigger phrase.

## Prerequisites (check before generating)

1. Read `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md §9` for the GitHub Issues repo. If it says "none yet", ask the user to provide the repo before proceeding.
2. Read `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md §11 Active feature` for the story ID and title.

## What to generate (two surfaces — both required)

### Surface 1: `docs/handoffs/<id>.md`

Create the file in the project repo using the 13-section template below.

### Surface 2: Tracking issue in the GitHub Issues repo

```bash
gh issue create \
  -R <issues-repo> \
  --title "feat(<scope>): <title> [design handoff]" \
  --body "Design handoff ready for implementation.

## Links
- Handoff doc: <link to docs/handoffs/<id>.md>
- Figma: <link>
- Preview: <GitHub Pages URL>
- Issue: <original issue link>

## Summary
<2-3 lines from the handoff §1>

## Definition of done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] WCAG 2.2 AA axe clean
- [ ] Unit tests written
- [ ] PR reviewed and CI green"
```

Cross-link both surfaces in the handoff doc body and the issue body.

## Post-generation steps

After generating the two surfaces:

1. Append a row to `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md §10 Handoffs shipped`.
2. Update the feature status in `PROJECT_KNOWLEDGE.md §11 Active feature` to `handed-off`.
3. Report both URLs to the user:
   - Handoff doc: `docs/handoffs/<id>.md`
   - Tracking issue: `https://github.com/<downstream-repo>/issues/<N>`

# UX Writing

## When to invoke

User asks to write, review, or improve UI copy: button labels, form labels, error messages, empty states, tooltips, onboarding copy, confirmation dialogs.

## The 10 rules (binding)

| Rule | Right | Wrong |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Sentence case | "Add team member" | "Add Team Member" |
| 2. Active voice | "Save changes" | "Changes will be saved" |
| 3. Action-first buttons | "Delete account" | "Account deletion" |
| 4. Specific not generic | "Upload CSV file" | "Upload file" |
| 5. No jargon | "Choose a workspace" | "Select a tenant context" |
| 6. Empty states have next action | "No reports yet. Create your first report." | "No reports found." |
| 7. Errors name problem + fix | "Email already in use. Sign in or use a different email." | "Invalid email." |
| 8. Confirmation dialogs use action label | "Delete" / "Cancel" | "Yes" / "No" |
| 9. Loading states are specific | "Saving changes…" | "Loading…" |
| 10. Tooltips supplementary | Icon + visible label; tooltip adds detail | Icon only, tooltip required to understand the action |

## Review format

When reviewing copy, return a table:

| Location | Current copy | Issue | Suggested copy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delete button | "Submit" | Not action-first; vague | "Delete account" |
| Empty state | "Nothing here." | No next action | "No projects yet. Create your first one." |

## Copy templates

### Empty state
```
[Illustration or icon]
<What's missing — noun phrase>
<Why it matters or what they can do here>
[Primary CTA button: action verb]
```

### Error message (inline)
```
<Problem in plain language.> <Fix: what to do next.>
```
Example: "This email is already registered. Sign in or use a different email address."

### Confirmation dialog
```
Title: <Action verb> <Object>? (e.g., "Delete project?")
Body: <Consequence — one sentence.> This cannot be undone.
Primary button: <Action verb> (e.g., "Delete")
Secondary: Cancel
```

### Loading state
```
<Verb + object>… (e.g., "Saving changes…", "Uploading file…", "Generating report…")
```

### Tooltip
```
<Sentence that supplements — never replaces — the visible label.>
```
